Python and JavaScript bindings for calling the Earth Engine API.

_**Important Note: Access to Google Earth Engine is currently only available to
trusted testers. The API is in active development, and users should expect the
API to change.  When (not if) API changes occur, applications that use the API
will likely need to be updated.**_
